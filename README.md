Hotel Management System is a Java-based application designed to manage room bookings, guest information, and loyalty tracking for a hotel. The project includes two versions: a terminal-based system located in the core package, and a graphical user interface (GUI) version using Java Swing in the gui package.

You can run the terminal version by navigating to the core folder and executing Main.java, and run the GUI version by compiling and launching GUIMain.java in the gui folder. The system demonstrates strong use of object-oriented programming principles, and serves as a learning project for both console and graphical Java applications.
